  ## Desription

 The SVG Logo Maker app is a tool designed to create customizable SVG logos efficiently. Users can specify text and color attributes, ensuring their logo reflects their brand's essence. With built-in shape integration, the app allows users to combine textual elements with geometric shapes for a more distinct visual impact. Through a series of tests, the app ensures the logo's text remains concise, and the final SVG output adheres to set specifications. This user-friendly app streamlines the process of logo creation, making it accessible to both designers and non-designers alike.
